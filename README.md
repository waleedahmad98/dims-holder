# Digital Identity Management System Through Blockchain - Holder 
The Digital Identity Management System (DIMS) is a blockchain based application aimed to provide secure method of storing and sharing digital credentials, certificates and degrees. It utitlizes decentralized networks to eliminate storage of important credentials on vulnerable servers that are prone to hijacking and hacking. The blockchain architecture makes sure that the credentials are tamper-proof by generating Non-fungible tokens of the credentials.

## Components
The DIMS architecture is made up of three main components:
<li> ISSUER </li>
<li> HOLDER </li>
<li> VERIFIER </li>

## DIMS Holder
The Holder application acts as a simple wallet for your Non-Fungible Token certificates. It also provides the ability to share credentials in a secure way by signing the degrees with your private key which a verifier can verify by decrypting with your public key.
